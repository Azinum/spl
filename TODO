- fix parsing bug where `;` is not detected after binary operation
- fix parsing bug where single `}` are not detected
- remove the ability, by ways of parsing, to define inlined functions (causes undefined behaviour, crashes)
- compile time evaluation of `trival` functions
- typed assignment operator

- before i begin work on the self hosted compiler i would like to implement:
	- user structs/types or some other method of creating structures e.g. expression matching or similar
