- fix parsing bug where `;` is not detected after binary operation
- fix parsing bug where single `}` are not detected
- remove the ability to define inlined functions (causes undefined behaviour, crashes)

- before i begin work on the self hosted compiler i would like to:
	- add user structs/types
	- type casting
